1. query_db_login($username, $password)
Vulnerability 1: SQL injections
    - the query will be composed by the strings given in 'username' and 'password' given as parameters in the function.
    - if there are inserted some special SQL characters or a different logic, the query will do what was not designed to do initially.
Vulnerability 2: XSS
     - the username provided as a login parameter will appear on the top of the user profile page.
     - any special HTML character, could provide a different layout and insert different source code to be executed by the browser engine at runtime.

Solution vulberability 1: prepared statement
    - the usage of the prepared statements provide parametrized queryes.
Solution vulberability 2: sanity checks for tag characters
    - a boolean function was implemented to return true if the characters '<' or '>' are found in the provided string.
    - if the string is suspected of XSS, then the flow will be interrupred and the user will be suggested to review the entered string.


2. get_message_rows()
Vulnerability: XSS
    - the function will return the list of messages that corresponds to their users
    - if a message has a '<' or '>' character, can be suspected by xss
    - that could lead for the client browser to execute something different that was intended.
Solution: sanity check for HTML inside the add_message_for_users function
    - a sanity check is done in the function add_message_for_users() that deals with the input messages.


3. add_message_for_user($username, $message)
Vulnerability: XSS
    - the function will store into the database the messages typed by the users;
    - if a message has a '<' or '>' character, can be suspected by xss
    - storing them as they are, can lay down to uploading different scripts, or other XSS abuses.
Solution: sanity check for HTML tags when adding the messages in the database
    - the sanity check xss function will return true if the passed string is suspected to hold some HTML tags.


4. is_valid_image($image_path)
Vulnerability: Unrestricted file upload
    - the user can upload any kind of file, even virus.exe instead of a photo.jpg.
Solution: restrict and decice the supported file formats
    - the application must accept only the predefined image formats. The others will be neglected.
    - the uploaded files will be verified with finfo_file() which returns details about the given file.
    - if the information is compatible with the alowed file types then the file is ok.


5. add_photo_path_to_user($username, $file_userphoto)
Vulnerability: Unrestricted file upload
    - the file must be verified and restricted to be only of the allowed types.

Solution: restrict the accepted file types
    - the function is_valid_image() will deal with it.    


6. get_photo_path_for_user($username)



7. get_memo_content_for_user($username, $memoname)



8. get_language_php($language)
Vulnerability 1: Path traversal
    - someone could insert path characters ans access unallowed things.
Vulnerability 2: File inclusion
    - instead of en/ro or the supported language files, someone could include a different script file.

Solution for vulberability 1: sanity check for '/', '\' and even '%', '#', '<' and '>', just in case.
Solution for vulberability 2: constraints for the language variable.
